# VideoAnalytics

Read the notes given in the .ipynb file. Apart from that, the final export of the video gave an error. The workaround for this is to manually download from the concerned file where the code has the out.mp4 video (The object detection and segmentation video from your algorithm) saved in your directory.

# Things to follow from now as we work on this project:

* Always add notes on what is the next intention as you code. So that the reader gets an idea on what the programmer intends to do next. And always add comments to each line of code even if you feel it is unnecessary to do so. 

* Add notes such as if you had to downgrade certain packages/libraries that was used in your code for it to work successfully. 

All of this because:

1. The project report creation becomes easy.

2. We get a clear idea later on in the project if we get stuck somewhere or would need clarity on some parts of the code. 

Cheers!
